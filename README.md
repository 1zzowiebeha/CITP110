# CITP110 - Intro to Python

Welcome.

This is proof of iteration for my *CIP110 - Intro to Python* class assignments at LCC.

At commits where I would normally squash previous commits
into one, I will add a note in the commit body.

This is because for iteration proof, I must retain minute progress indicators instead
of squashing them all into one \[feature|bug fix\] unit.
